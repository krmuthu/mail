Hi,
 
We will start analysing this request and will share the timeline.
 
Quick observations on page level SEO:
 
1.       Ideally page URLs should not have numeric value, unless we will have consecutive pages. However, they should still be used as next-step-one-touch-2
2.       Each page should have it’s unique SEO meta data instead of copying from another page. Else this may lead to SEO Amalgamation
 
I know you don’t want this page to be indexed and hence the above may not make sense now. However, in future, if we plan to index the page, we should consider the above points.
I would still recommend that you consult the SEO agency to provide alternate SEO URL and meta data. Meanwhile, we will initiate detailed analysis and page development.
 
 
Thanks,
Muthukumar Karunanithi
